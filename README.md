## 🚀 Dozer
Dozer lets you hide menu bar items to give your Mac a cleaner look.

###### You might also like [FiScript](https://github.com/Mortennn/FiScript) which lets you execute custom scripts on your files/folders from the context menu in Finder.

## ⚙️ Install

Easiest way [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/):

	brew cask install dozer	
Manual:

1. [Download](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer/releases/latest), open, and drag the app to the Applications folder.
2. Open Dozer and drag the icon in your menu bar (hold CMD) to the right so it is between some other icons.

## Usage
* `⌘` + drag to move the Dozer icons around in the menu bar.
* Click any of the Dozer icons to hide menu bar items.
* Right-click the Dozer icon to open the about page of Dozer.

(N.B.: Just as shown in the demo gif, you are supposed to put the icons to hide to the left of both dots, not between them, as [some](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer/issues/50) might have mistakenly thought at first sight.)

## Requirements
macOS version >= 10.13
